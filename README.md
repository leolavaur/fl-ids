# FL & IDS: Monorepo for my PhD thesis experiments.

This repository contains the configuration and data for the personal projects performed during my PhD.
The `exps` directory notably contains multiple experiments, some of which have led to publications (see [COSE 2025](https://github.com/leolavaur/cose_2025.git)).

The repository itself has grown to an unmanageable size and is not meant to be cloned anymore.
An archive of the repository is available at [this link](http://seafile.srcd.imta.fr/f/39819a57de8f449d84b2/?dl=1).
